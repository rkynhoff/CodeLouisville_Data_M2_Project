# CodeLouisville_Data_M2_Project
My first Python coding project with Pandas and Matplotlib using a data source from Kaggle 

Please refer to the Jupiter Notebook titled "MiniProject_V4.ipynb" for the most recent updates to this project. For some Markdown areas or comments in code areas, you may need to select "View > Word Wrap" to see everything on one page. 

Note that I could not answer my original question nor was I able to find a way to answer my second question with the time allotted prior to final submission of 11:59 PM on 12/20/2024. 

I welcome any feedback on improvements and how to plot a specific value from a column against all values in another column of different datatypes. :)
